         <title>Windows binary of 0.9.9.109 now in the download area as normal</title>
         <link>http://code.google.com/p/torchat/downloads/detail?name=torchat-windows-0.9.9.109.zip</link>
         <description>My quota has now been increased by Google and the windows
         binary can now be found in the download area. Current version is
         0.9.9.109. This version has proven to be the most stable version to date.
         Several bugs have been fixed in this release and the process of
         connecting to buddies is now faster and more reliable.</description>

         <title>Version 0.9.9.109 is out</title>
         <link>http://code.google.com/p/torchat/downloads/detail?name=torchat-source-0.9.9.109.zip</link>
         <description>Version 0.9.9.109 is out. I have made some changes in the way and the order
         in which buddies on the list are connected. New in this version is support for a configuration file.
         You can now use an already running tor proxy in your network by specifying adress and port
         numbers (you mus also configure a hidden service on this proxy). Unfortubetely I hit the quota 
         and am still waiting for Google to increase my limit until I can upload the windows binary.</description>
