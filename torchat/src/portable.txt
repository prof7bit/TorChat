This file (portable.txt) is used to indicate that 
TorChat is running in portable mode. If this file 
is found in this folder, all config and data will 
be stored in the program folder itself, rather 
than in the user's home directory.

If you delete this file, then TorChat will create
a folder ~/.torchat (or %AppData%\torchat on w32) 
on the computer's harddisk and store its 
configuration and data there, so if you plan to 
run the program from a removable media, leave this
file where it is.

Distributors and packagers can remove this file if
a fixed installation of TorChat is desired.

The contents of this file are irrelevant. It could
also be completely empty. It is only checked if
there is a file "portable.txt" or not.
